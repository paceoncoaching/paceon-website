What happens after I sign up?
Within 24 hours of signing up, you'll receive a welcome email with a detailed questionnaire covering your training history, goals, available time, injury history, and current fitness. We'll then schedule a call to discuss your programme before your first training plan is delivered.

When will I receive my training plan?
Initial plans are typically delivered within 5-7 days of completing your discovery call and onboarding. Ongoing plans are delivered generally delivered on a fortnightly basis, giving you time to review upcoming sessions and ask questions.

How do we communicate?
Standard athletes communicate primarily through email and TrainingPeaks messaging, with responses typically within 24 hours on weekdays. Premium athletes have access to unlimited messaging support via WhatsApp with priority response times plus scheduled monthly video calls.

How often are plans adjusted?
Standard plans are reviewed and adjusted weekly based on your completed sessions and feedback. Premium plans can be adjusted in real-time as circumstances change - illness, unexpected work demands, or performance breakthroughs can all trigger immediate modifications.

What if I can't complete a session?
Life happens. Simply log what you did (or didn't do) in TrainingPeaks with a brief note explaining why, and the plan will adjust accordingly. Missed sessions don't derail your programme - they inform smarter decisions about how to progress.

Do I need specific equipment or technology?
At minimum, you need a way to track your sessions - a GPS watch for running, bike computer for cycling, or smartphone app. A heart rate monitor is highly recommended. Power meters for cycling are valuable but not essential. All equipment should sync with TrainingPeaks.

How do you track my progress?
Progress is monitored through multiple indicators: completed session data (pace, power, heart rate), subjective feedback (how sessions felt), training load trends, benchmark sessions, and race results. Premium athletes also receive detailed performance reports through bespoke dashboards (coming soon).

What information do you need from me?
Honest communication is essential. We need to know how sessions felt (easy/hard/as expected), any life stressors affecting training (work, sleep, illness), and your subjective sense of fatigue and readiness. The more transparent you are, the better we can adapt your programme.

Can I still train with friends or groups?
Absolutely. Social training is valuable for motivation and enjoyment. Where possible, we structure your programme to accommodate group sessions or rides. Just let us know your regular group commitments during onboarding.

What happens during race week?
Premium athletes receive comprehensive race preparation including detailed strategy documents, pacing plans, and increased communication in the days leading up to the event. Standard athletes receive race-week guidance and modified training to ensure proper taper and readiness.

How do check-ins work?
Standard athletes have structured weekly check-ins via email or TrainingPeaks messaging. Premium athletes have monthly video calls via Teams (30-45 mins) to review progress, discuss challenges, and refine approach, plus ongoing messaging throughout the month.

What if I need to pause coaching?
You can pause or cancel anytime with one month's notice. If you need to take a break due to injury, life circumstances, or off-season rest, we can discuss pausing your subscription and resuming when you're ready to train again.
