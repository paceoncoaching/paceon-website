How long is the minimum commitment?
There's no lock-in contract, but coaching works best with a minimum 6-month commitment. Meaningful performance gains take time - structured periodisation and consistent training compound over months, not weeks. You're free to pause or cancel with one month's notice.

What sports do you coach?
We coach triathlon (all distances), road cycling, and running (5K to marathon and ultra). Our programmes can be tailored to single-sport athletes or multisport competitors preparing for specific events or long-term development.

How do I receive my training plan?
Training programmes are delivered through TrainingPeaks, an industry-standard platform that syncs with most GPS watches and cycling computers. You'll receive a weekly plan with detailed session descriptions, with updates as adjustments are made.

Can I switch between Standard and Premium?
Absolutely. If your needs change -  race season approaching, work commitments increasing, or you want more support - you can upgrade or downgrade at any time with one month's notice.

What if I miss sessions or get injured?
Life happens, and training adapts. Both programmes include adjustments for missed sessions, illness, injury, or unexpected life events. The difference is Premium offers more responsive, real-time modifications, while Standard adjusts weekly.

Do you work with beginners?
Yes. We coach athletes across all experience levels, from complete beginners targeting their first event to seasoned competitors chasing podiums. Programmes are individualised to your current ability and goals.

How much time do I need to train?
This depends entirely on your goals. Most athletes we work with train 6-15 hours per week, but programmes can be designed for as little as 5 hours or as much as 20+. We build your plan around the time you realistically have available.

What's the difference between Standard and Premium?
Standard provides structured programming with weekly oversight - ideal for self-motivated athletes who execute well independently. Premium adds unlimited messaging, monthly video calls, detailed session feedback, and race strategy support - perfect for athletes wanting comprehensive, hands-on coaching.

Can I trial coaching before committing?
We offer a complimentary discovery call where we discuss your goals, experience, and whether coaching is the right fit. This isn't a sales pitch - it's an honest conversation to determine if we're aligned before you commit.

Do you offer in-person coaching or training camps?
Currently, all coaching is delivered remotely through digital platforms. However, if you're Perth-based, occasional in-person sessions or training rides can be arranged on a case-by-case basis.
